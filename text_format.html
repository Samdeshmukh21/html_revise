    <p>The league's inception was influenced by the popularity of the kabaddi tournament at the 2006 Asian Games. The Pro Kabaddi League uses a franchise-based model and its first season was held in <b>2014</b> with eight teams each of which has paid fees of up to <mark>US$250,000 (â‚¹20,00,000)</mark> to join.[4][5]

        There were doubts over whether the Pro Kabaddi League would be successful, noting that many leagues were attempting to emulate the IPL's business model and success and that, unlike cricket, there were relatively fewer well-known players in Kabaddi. However, it was also noted that kabaddi was widely played in grassroots community settings, and could thus attract a wide variety of rural and metropolitan viewers for advertisers to target if the league gained significant attraction.[4]</p>
